# Fresh Fruits CSS & HTML5

This is a simple yet eye-catching web page showcasing fresh fruits, built with CSS and HTML5. The page features:

- Vivid product images: The page prominently displays photos of three popular fruits: an apple, a dragon fruit, and an orange. The images are high-quality and capture the fruits' vibrant colors and textures.
- Clear calls to action: Each fruit has a large "BUY" button next to it, encouraging users to make a purchase. The buttons are styled with contrasting colors to stand out and attract attention.
- Informative product details: Below each fruit image, you can find its name, price per kilogram, weight, and a star rating. This information provides users with a quick overview of the product before they click on the "BUY" button.
This is a great example of how simple HTML and CSS can be used to create a visually appealing and informative web page. The clean layout, uncluttered design, and focus on fresh produce make this page a pleasure to look at and easy to navigate.
